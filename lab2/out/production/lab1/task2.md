Conditions:

Each rectangle is represented like this: (lengthOfFirstSide, lengthOfSecondSide) (tuple) We do not consider negative numbers Your goal is:

Show me three ways how to create list of rectangles (just in plain code, I mean different operators and use of list constructor) Create function, which will return list of rectangles, where area is bigger than 2nd argument (first one is list created in goal number 1) Create function, which prints one rectangle like "(lengthOfFirstSide, lengthOfSecondSide) => area: area" Use both methods to print list of rectangles, where area is bigger than your lucky number
